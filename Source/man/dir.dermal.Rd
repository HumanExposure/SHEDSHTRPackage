\value{
dir.derm  For each person, the calculated direct dermal exposure that occurs when a chemical-containing product
is used. This does not include later contact with treated objects, which is indirect exposure.
}
\description{
Models the dermal exposure scenario for each theoretical person.
}
\details{
The dermal exposure scenario is relatively straightforward. The function produces a prevalence value, which reflects
the fraction of the population who use this scenario at all. It also produces a frequency value, which is the mean number of
times per year this scenario occurs among that fraction of the population specified by prevalence.
Since SHEDS operates on the basis of one random day, the frequency is  divided by 365 and then passed to the
\code{\link{p.round}} (probabilistic rounding) function, which rounds either up or down to the nearest integer. Very common
events may happen more than once in a day.
The function also produces a mass variable, which refers to the  mass of the product in grams in a typical usage event.
The composition is the percentage of that mass that is the chemical in question.
The resid variable measures the fraction that is likely to remain on the skin when the usage event ends.
The final output is the total dermal exposure for each chemical-individual combination in micrograms, which is the product of
the above variables multiplied by a factor of 1E+06.
