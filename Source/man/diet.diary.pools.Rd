diet.diary.pools(diaries, specs)
}
\arguments{
\item{specs}{Output of the \code{\link{read.run.file}} function, which can be modified by the \code{\link{update.specs}}
function before input into \code{diet.diary.pools}.}

\item{diet.diaries}{A data set created internally in SHEDS.HT through the \code{\link{read.diet.diaries}} function.
The data are daily diaries of dietary consumption by food group. Each line represents one person-day, with demographic
variables followed by amounts (in grams/day) for a list of food types indicated by a short abbreviation on the header line.}
}
\value{
dpool A vector of lists.  The length of \code{dpool} is the product of the gender  and age inputs specified in
the \code{\link{Run}} file. Each element is a list of acceptable diet diary numbers for each year of age and each gender
combination.
In addition, if the function runs successfully, the following message will be printed: "Dietary Diary Pooling completed"
}
\description{
Assigns activity diaries from the \code{\link{Diet_diaries}} input on the \code{\link{Run}} file
(read through the \code{\link{read.run.file}} function) to pools based on age and gender.
}
\details{
The \code{diet.diary.pools} function assigns the dietary diaries to pools. A given diary may belong to many pools,
since every year of age has its own pool. Large pools may contain a list of several hundred diary numbers. The code contains
four loops and on each step performs a sub-setting of the list of diary numbers.
}
\note{
The input to \code{diet.diary.pools}, \code{diet.diaries}, is created by reading in the \code{\link{Diet_diaries}}
input file (specified on the \code{\link{Run}} file) with the \code{\link{read.diet.diaries}} function within the
\code{\link{run}} function.
