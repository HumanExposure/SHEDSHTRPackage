combine_output(run.name = specs$run.name, out.file = "SHEDSOutFCS.csv",
  metrics = c("5\%", "50\%", "75\%", "95\%", "99\%", "mean", "sd"))
}
\arguments{
\item{run.name}{default = name of last run (in current R session)}

\item{out.file}{default="SHEDSOutFCS.csv"}

\item{metrics}{the summary statsistics to be pulled. default = c("5\%", "50\%", "75\%", "95\%", "99\%","mean","sd")}
}
\value{
finaldata A R object that has "exp.dermal", "exp.ingest", m"exp.inhal", "dose.inhal", "dose.intake", "abs.dermal.ug",
        "abs.ingest.ug", "abs.inhal.ug", "abs.tot.ug", "abs.tot.mgkg", "ddd.mass" for the chemcial of question. This is tablated for 
        the "5\%", "50\%", "75\%", "95\%", "99\%", quantile of exposure as well as the mean and sd 
        \cr
        "finaldata,paste0("output/",run.name,"/",out.file.csv") this is the CSV of finaldata
}
\description{
combine_output is a post-processing tool that extracts selected statistics (those specified in the 'metrics' argument)
from the 'allstats' file for each chemical in a single model run, and combines them onto out.file.
}
\details{
In a multichemical run, SHEDS creates separate output files for each chemical.  If the analyst wants to compare
         exposure or dose metrics across chemicals, use combine_output to put the relevant information for all chemicals together
         on one file.
