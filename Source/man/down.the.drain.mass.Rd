\value{
exp.ddd.mass The calculated quantity of chemical going down the drain (i.e., from laundry detergent) and
entering the sewer system per person per day.

\description{
Models the quantity of chemical entering the waste water system on a per person-day basis.
}
\details{
This function models the simplest of all the current scenarios. It evaluates the amount of chemical entering 
the waste water system, on a per person-day basis.  The "exposure" is to a system, not a person, but this method uses 
one person's actions to estimate their contribution to the total. 
The function produces a \code{prevalence} value, which reflects the fraction of the population who use this scenario at
all. It also produces a \code{frequency} value, which is the mean number  of times per year this scenario occurs among
that fraction of the population specified by prevalence. 
Since SHEDS operates on the basis of one random day, the \code{frequency} is  divided by 365 and then passed to the 
\code{\link{p.round}} (probabilistic rounding) function, which rounds either up or down to the nearest integer. Very 
common events may happen more than once in a day.
The function also produces a \code{mass} variable, which refers to the  mass of the product in grams in a typical
usage event. The \code{composition} is the percentage of that mass that is the chemical in question.
The final output, \code{exp.ddd.mass}, is the product of the \code{prevalence}, \code{frequency}, \code{mass}, 
\code{composition}, and the fraction going down the drain (\code{f.drain}, a variable in the \code{sd} input).
The result is in grams per person-day.
