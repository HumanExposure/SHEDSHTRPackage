act.diary.pools(diaries, specs)
}
\arguments{
\item{diaries}{A data set created internally in SHEDS.HT through the \code{\link{read.act.diaries}} function. The data are
activity diaries, which indicate the amount of time and level of metabolic activity in various micro environments.
Each line of data represents one person-day (24 hours).}

\item{specs}{Output of the \code{\link{read.run.file}} function, which can be modified by the \code{\link{update.specs}}
function before input into \code{act.diary.pools}.}
}
\value{
pool A vector of lists.  The length of \code{pool} is the product of the genders, seasons, and ages inputs specified
in the \code{\link{Run}} file. Each element is a list of acceptable activity diary numbers for each year of age, gender,
weekend, and season combination. For example, \code{pool}[100] may have the name M0P99, which indicates that it is for
males, on weekdays, in spring,for age=99.
In addition, If the function runs successfully, the following message will be printed:
"Activity Diary Pooling completed"
}
\description{
Assigns activity diaries from the \code{\link{Activity_diaries}} input on the \code{\link{Run}} file
(read through the \code{\link{read.act.diaries}} function) to pools based on age, gender, and season
}
\details{
The \code{act.diary.pools} function assigns the activity diaries to pools. A given diary may belong to
many pools, since every year of age has its own pool. Large pools may contain a list of several hundred diary numbers.
The code contains four loops and on each step performs a sub-setting of the list of diary numbers.
}
\note{
The input to \code{act.diary.pools}, diaries, is created by reading in the Activity_diaries input file (specified on
the \code{\link{Run}} file) with the \code{\link{read.act.diaries}} function within the \code{\link{run}} function.
