\usage{
scen.factor.indices(sdat, expgen)
}
\arguments{
\item{sdat}{The chemical-scenario data specific to a given combination of chemical and scenario.}

\item{expgen}{Non-media specific exposure factors as a data table. Output from \code{\link{gen.factor.tables}}}
}
\value{
Returns indices of scenario-specific exposure factors for each relevant age and gender combination. The output
is only generated internally.
}
\description{
Constructs scenario-specific exposure factors for each relevant combination of age and  gender. The input is derived
internally from the Source_vars file specified on the Run file.
}
\details{
The constructed factors are not media-specific, although they are scenario-specific,  and most scenarios include
just one surface medium.
This function evaluats the scenario-specific exposure factors separately from the other factors because these
scenario-specific factors may change with every chemical and scenario, whereas the other factors remain the same across
chemicals and scenarios for each person.
