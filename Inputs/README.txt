Note: The "source chemical", "source variable", and "source scenario" files that are distributed with SHEDS-HT are for demonstration purposes only, and do not represent any real chemical data. The exception: the source_chem_products.csv, source_vars_products.csv, and source_scen_products.csv files are the default SHEDS files for consumer product sources.  The source_chem_products.csv file was derived from the October 2016 version of EPA's CPDat database.  The derivation of the data in the source_vars_products.csv file is described in the document "SHEDS Source Variables File for Consumer Product Sources", available in the SHEDS documentation folder.
