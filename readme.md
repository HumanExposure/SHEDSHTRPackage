SHEDS-HT R package and default input files

The United States Environmental Protection Agency through its Office of Research and Development funded and collaborated in the research and development of this software, in part under Contract EP-C-14-001 to ICF International. The model is publicly available in Beta version form. All input data used for a given application should be reviewed by the researcher so that the model results are based on appropriate data sources for the given application. This model, default input files, and R package are under continued development and testing. The model equations and approach are published in the peer-reviewed literature (Isaacs et al. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2014, 48, 12750-12759). The data included herein do not represent and should not be construed to represent any Agency determination or policy.
